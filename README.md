# Reimagining Cities with AI
India is a Rapidly urbanising country with over 377 Million people living in urban areas in 2011. For a country that is so heavily and rapidly urbanised, there is little to no "Urban Planning" that is being done, resulting in Haphazard growth of cities and a dysfunction web of departments offering service delivery

This phenomena of rapid urbanisation can be attributed to a multitude of parameters ranging from Changing demographic, social factors, employment oppurtunities etc.. But whats alarming is the aftermath of unmanaged and unplanned urbanisation, leading to various chanllenged that both contrubute and get a/ffected by climate change. For this to happen, Cities need to grow more resilient. Resilient to climate chage and its effects, resilient to economic fluctuations, resilient to infrastructure failures

Currently, neither our cities, nor the institutions and the institutional frameworks steering the cities are equipped with resources, tools and expertise to handle urbanisation. And the way our institutions are setup and operate is the key to managing a city. Majority of the citys functions and decisions can be data driven, be it traffic, Water, Waste, Electricity...and many more. Currently all this data is siloed and doesnt operate cross departments, which leads to this issue haphazardness. This is where AI can potentially plugin and be a gamechanger. 

The key idea of this concept is to intensify the interactions between the departments. It is imperative that data is the most valued commodity of this era. Every department generates multitudes of data through their serice delivery and it is barely digitised. Imagine multiple stream of data coming from various departments synthesising to give you real time data driven insight. If the particulars of your water supply and consumption talk to your electricity consumption to give real time insights on your consumption. Imagine the ticketing information from the busses helps optimise frequency of the busses according to the day of time

There could be a ton of smart urban solutions that can be tailor made to cities across india, according to their intricasises. but the core to solve this issue is the data and how it flows in the system. If we could strengthen these data pipelines across departments with the help of AI, it would be a gamechanger in data drivern urban oplanning and desicion making

##  The Hypothesis ##

Adopting a dynamic, data-driven and an AI powered approach to Master Plans enhances their adaptability, allowing for real-time urban development insights and decision-making, thereby significantly improving urban planning and management outcomes

Urban services can become interoperable once the core data where the interactions primarily happen do have identifiers that can aggreagate multiple datasets. This will not only help to deploy citizen services faster, but can be crucial to aggregate data but to analyse and present it to beaurocrats who can than take informed decision making.

## Core Principle ##
This Hightened Reality digital master plan should be built with a key feature of decentralised nature in mind. This should be an environment and a platform for seamless data exchange but it should also not hold monopoly over any data. All the data would be aggregated and managed by concerned departments only
